<h1>天 History</h1>
Akuma and his brother Gouken were students of Goutetsu. Goutetsu taught a nameless life-threatening martial art, which incorporates elements of Karate, Judo, and Kempo. He also taught the Shun Goku Satsu (literally Instant Hell Murder), a lethal technique which, although incredibly powerful, puts the user in considerable danger.<br><br>

As the brothers progressed under Goutetsu's tutelage, a dispute arose on the true nature of their fighting style and the path to master it. Gouken, unable to accept the violent nature and the Satsui no Hadou of his fighting style, left Goutetsu to begin his own dojo, however Goutetsu did not stop his student Gouken from leaving and even allowed him build his own dojo. Akuma continued Goutetsu's teachings and vowed to use their fighting style as it was intended.<br><br>

In order to learn Shun Goku Satsu, Akuma embraced the principle of Satsui no Hadō, the "Surge of the Intent to Kill/Killing Intent". Through Satsui no Hadō, Akuma was forced to give up any compassion he held towards other human beings. In addition, Akuma realized his limits as a martial artist could be expanded, and left Goutetsu's guidance of enlightenment to train alone to gain more power; however, due to embracing the Satsui no Hadou to his fullest extent, he developed a lust to fight to the death, unlike Goutetsu, who had been able to use the Satsui no Hadou without giving in to its dark side and did not constantly use it to its fullest extent.<br><br>

After coming back from his island, Akuma went back to Goutetsu, and fought and killed him with the Shun Goku Satsu. Akuma, believing that he was the true master of the Art, took the prayer beads of his dead master and placed it on his neck. When Gouken went to visit his master to see how he was doing, he only found his body lifeless and saw his brother, now no longer looking human. Gouken, shocked to see that his younger brother took the life of their master, berated Akuma, who said nothing and left for the woods.<br><br>

Many years later, Akuma fought Gouken, while the then-young duo of Ryu and Ken watched. Akuma told Gouken that he was not strong enough to face him without giving in the killing intent; Gouken retorted, saying the art was much more then just death and destruction, accusing Akuma of dishonoring their master's name. Akuma told his brother that Goutetsu did not truly understand the art and was a fool for not using the Satsui no Hadou to its fullest extent. The fight continued, and Gouken won. Akuma told his brother to kill him, but Gouken had no intention of murdering his own kin, prompting Akuma to call him weak for sparing the life of a strong opponent and declare that he would return.<br><br>

A couple years later, Akuma came back to Gouken's dojo and fought him in battle, using the Shun Goku Satsu on him. Akuma believed him dead, not knowing that Gouken had somehow lived through the attack by emptying his soul, and was only in a coma. Ken saw the flash of the attack while running to the dojo, but arrived only to find Gouken on the floor. Knowing who was behind this, Ken confronted Akuma in the woods and fought him, only to be defeated. After defeating Ken, Akuma disappeared without a trace.<br><br> 

<h1> 天 Personality</h1>
Akuma (literally demon) is a cold and extremely powerful warrior whose sole purpose of existance is to hone his fighting skills by battling and destroying strong foes. He rarely displays any sign of emotions and likes to occasionally test himself against worthy rivals (Gen, Oro...). In combat, Akuma almost never resorts to his true strength since he is yet to find an opponent who is to withstand the full extent of his powers. <br><br>

<h1> 天 Moral Code</h1>
Most of the time, Akuma abides the code of the warrior. He fights to improve his skills, defeat powerful foes or, in rare occasions, to gauge other's abilities. Although he killed his teacher (Goutetsu) and believed he did the same with his brother (Gouken), Akuma did so in combat, and thus can be said to have not transgressed on his principles. He fights only warriors that he deems worthy or the ones he believes have the potential to become the best. He backed out of a duel with Gen once he found out that Gen is fatally ill. During the events of SFA2, Akuma fought Ryu only to gain insight on Ryu's abilities while during SF3 he faced Oro in order to test his own strength.<br><br>

Although Akuma usually prefers an even bout, it is not uncommon for him to deliver a lethal sneak attack at an unprepared opponent (as he did with Bison, Gill and Adon's unnamed rival). The purpose of this can perhaps be found in the evil nature of Satsui no Hado itself which could have corrupted Akuma's ways.<br><br>
