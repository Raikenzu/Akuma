<h1>Backstory</h1>
Tobias as a child was branded with the mark of the flying Raijin, a symbol of his heritage and traditions. His father was a very passionate and merciless instilled hard love and lessons of extreme discipline early on in his life. This had a negative effect on his psyche, twisting his logic and ideologies for better or worse . His mother and older sister are the lights of his life, often showing him compassion and genuine love which helped teach him right from wrong. 
When he started attending school he got into fights with the kids who tried to bully him, and naturally using his father’s fighting lessons he destroyed those bullies without mercy. Delivering fierce and powerful blows that would destroy those normal kids. Toby was much stronger and tougher than any nine year old in his school, and that trend would follow him as he aged and lived his life. However, while he was in fifth grade, he was pulled from his school and moved to a school for the physically and martially gifted called Taiyo Academy. This offered Tobias a new challenge, as the students here were as strong or stronger than he was. Excited by his new home, as it required him to live on campus; a fiery determination was born inside him, he’d work hard to push himself mentally, physically, and spiritually to achieve new greater heights of power. He’d make many friends while he attended Taiyo, but ultimately, that was all left behind after he graduated. Anyone who wanted to maintain their friendship with him was encouraged to find him in the heat of battle.<br><br>
 ”I’m going to be the Street Fighter World Champion!”
<br><br>

<h1>Personality</h1>
Tobias is a hot headed guy full of explosive energy. He’s passionate about his family’s fighting spirit and techniques. He’s been hardened by his experiences at Taiyo middle school and at home, he was raised to speak his mind honestly even if that meant pissing off the opposition. He resorts to violence when disrespected and won’t hesitate to destroy anything or anyone who dare cross him. Though beneath all that 'perceived' abrasiveness he’s got a soft spot for those he deems worthy of his friendship. He’s determined to achieve his dreams, and constantly pushes himself beyond his limits. He travels the world as a free spirit to challenge strong opponents, no matter their shape or size.<br><br>
<h1>Skills and Abilities</h1>
<b>FIGHTING STYLE:</b> <u>The Planar Fist:</u> A mixed martial arts created by Tobias, it blends Hapkido, Muay Thai, and Jeet Kune Do(currently studying) with his planar abilities. It focuses on using his inhumane strength and speed to deliver decisive counter attacks and fluid offensive strikes once he’s learned how his opponent(s) fight. He’s a firm believer in using all of his body, he’s learned to move without wasting motion allowing him to generate obscene amounts of kinetic energy in short and tight spaces without the use of his planar vibrations. While his vibrational state is active the true potential of his body begins to emerge. 
<br><br>
Physical Capabilities: Tobias undergoes a strict training regimen to maintain and push the limits of his physique. Over forty percent of his muscle fibers have been turned into Pink Muscle. What is Pink Muscle? To explain this we’d need to explore Red and White Muscle. Red Muscle Fibers have low explosive power but high endurance allowing for long durations of use. White Muscle Fibers have high explosive power but have low endurance. Now pink muscle fibers have high explosive power, without loss in endurance. He believes this 40/30/30 split build offers him the most power for his stature and build, without the loss of endurance. He can deliver furious blows that can crumble several feet of reinforced concrete, punch through various reinforced metals, and total automobiles in just a few hits. Tobias’ movements are inhumane, often a blur to the untrained eye. While his resonance is active everything about him is exponentially multiplied. His basic senses are all amplified and considered animalistic and are also amplified during the vibrational state. 
<br><br>
Planar Resonance: As Tobias grew, he discovered a hum, a resonance that surfaced from his being as he trained and honed his mind, body and soul. Eventually what would manifest from his Aetherian soul, was a connection to the upper dimensions that would grant him powers beyond his wildest dreams. Troubled and confused he asked his Father about this phenomena. His father explained that there are beings born with pieces of Deus integrated into their genetic code, allowing them to manifest the Planar Resonance and remove their growth limiter. He also explained that people who manifest these abilities go on to do great things and influence the lives of many around them. It’s believed that many Aetherians existed throughout history. Tobias was encouraged to train with this ability and seek out individuals who have the ability to manifest the Resonance. 
<br><br>
There are four higher dimensions above the mortal plane, Physicallis, Mentallis, Astrallis, and Spirituallis. Each one represents a specific source of energy, though limitless, it has a strain on the physical body. 
<br><br>
Physicallis is kinetic energy in perpetual motion represented by the Earth, Tobias has only scratched the surface on his Resonance, thus he can only generate energy from this plane in small amounts. 
<Br><br>
Mentallis is Psionic Energy in perpetual motion, represented by the water element, it allows one to generate pockets of psionic energy within their mental resonance. This acts like telekinesis. Not yet unlocked.
<br><br>
Astrallis is Emotional Energy in perpetual motion, represented by the Lightning Element it allows one to gain access to the Emotional Spectrum, allowing one to generate power based on their emotions. Not yet unlocked.
<br><br>
Spirituallis is essentially the realm where souls are generated and thought to be the most powerful of the four. Can only be accessed once the previous three have been mastered. 
<br><br>
Affinity: The soul and resonance can generate a color based off their life experiences, emotional state, and morality. 
<br><br>
Tobias’ soul and resonance is black, black is regarded as the neutral color as those with this color can use all four of the resonance types equally. 
<br><br>
Notes: Tobias can detect another person Resonance through sight, sound, and his third eye alone. He can also discern what their affinity is based on those two senses alone.
